# SmallScreenSmackdown

This is a collection of scripts used in the game Small Screen Smackdown which is available on Itch.io. This collection showcases my C#
scripts I made for the game. They contain parts of network code that was made by Matti Vikberg, another programmer working on the game
this was a month long game development process and the game game out working with two player online multiplayer and three playable characters
with unique skills to be used in the fights.
